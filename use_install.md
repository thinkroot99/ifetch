Certainly! Here are the instructions for using the script:

1. **Download the Script:**
   - Download the script to your local machine. You can copy the script into a file named `install.sh`.

2. **Make the Script Executable:**
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the `install.sh` file.
   - Run the following command to make the script executable:
     ```
     chmod +x install.sh
     ```

3. **Run the Script:**
   - Run the script using the following command:
     ```
     ./install.sh
     ```

4. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - The script will download the `ifetch.sh` script from GitHub and grant it execution permissions.
   - It will update the PATH variable to include the `~/.bin` directory.
   - It will create a symbolic link to `ifetch.sh` in `/usr/local/bin`.
   - You may need to enter your password when creating the symbolic link using `sudo`.

5. **Verify Installation:**
   - After the script completes successfully, you can verify that `ifetch` is installed by running the following command:
     ```
     ifetch
     ```

6. **View System Information:**
   - Once installed, you can use `ifetch` to display system information by running the following command:
     ```
     ifetch
     ```

That's it! You have now installed `ifetch` and can use it to view system information on your Linux system.
